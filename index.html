          <h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
          <p>
            As the League of Legends was established to prevent further Rune
            Wars on Valoran, the neutral aligned summoners called forth
            exceptional individuals, referred to as 'champions', to battle on
            the Fields of Justice in order to settle disputes. These champions
            have joined the League for various reasons. Some are soldiers who
            have pledged their allegiance to a particular nation and fight in
            their nation's interests. Some are renowned warriors who seek to
            prove themselves against Valoran's most powerful beings. Some are
            prisoners of the League, forced to do the League's bidding as
            punishment. Some may even be strange creatures from other worlds,
            hoping to bring stability or further discord to Runeterra. For
            whatever the champion's reason, they have gained the interest of the
            League of Legends.
